Functionality:
  Reading all registers
  Reading specific registers
  Writing specific registers
  Resetting the camera via software.
  Writing known configurations:
    1: Linux driver example from here: http://acoptex.com/uploads/modifiedOV7670code.ino
    2: VGA, QVGA, QQVGA, YUV, BayerRGB, RGB565 from here: https://github.com/ComputerNerd/ov7670-no-ram-arduino-uno

Required Pin connections:
  2 -> SIO_D
  3 -> SIO_C
  9 -> XCLK (if not supplied from elsewhere)

Tested with:
  Arduino Yun

Likely working with:
  Arduino Leonardo
  Arduino Uno

 As far as sensible the code is in compliance with the data sheet: http://web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2015/tools/OV7670_2006.pdf
 For writing registers please consult the data sheet. Otherwise you may be writing reserved registers.
 Both low and high-level interfacing with the I2C-hardware work without issues. The low level code is kept for clairty.
 Parts of the low level code were taken from here: http://acoptex.com/uploads/modifiedOV7670code.ino

 Be aware of bugs. Reset the Arduino if you have the feeling that something went wrong. Please comment your suggestions and findings on github.
